# TheBoxOffice
This problem was given to me by CHESS Health
- You run a Box Office at a movie theater
- The theater has 5 screens for movies, and customers can pick a movie to buy tickets for
- There are only a certain number of tickets available for each movie
- At the end of the day, a final report is printed with how each movie performed that day

## Usage
- Run the Main class
- The employee enters 5 movies and their number of tickets available in the format of `name, tickets` (for example `The Truman Show, 50`)
- The customer then gets to choose a movie by typing in its name, then gets to choose a valid number of tickets they want to buy for that movie
- If the user enters a blank for a movie name, the day ends and the final report is printed

## Notes
- Some errors may not have been handled (such as inputing strings where there should be numbers)
